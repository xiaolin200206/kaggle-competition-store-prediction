#🚀 Project Showcase: Kaggle Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting

I'm excited to share my latest project on Kaggle: Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting! Through this project, I gained valuable insights into time series data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection.

🔍 Key Learnings:
✅ Handling missing values (forward fill, backfill, and feature engineering)
✅ Understanding lag, rolling, and resampling techniques—when and why to use them
✅ Selecting the right model for time series forecasting
✅ Differentiating between parameters, hyperparameters, and hyperparameter tuning
✅ Comparing error metrics: MSE, MAE, RMSE, and RMSLE

🛠 Tech Stack & Tools Used:
🔹 Models: Linear Regression, LightGBM, GridSearchCV
🔹 TensorFlow: Sequential, LSTM, Dense layers
🔹 Scikit-Learn: TimeSeriesSplit, LabelEncoder, MSE, RMSLE

This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of time series forecasting techniques and improve my model optimization skills.
